# snkr-finder

This is module to handle creation and execution of a simple tool to find similar sneakers called "Sneaker Finder". This repository is built wiht the fastai API and nbdev, and is a full refactor of a project initated as part of an Insight Data Science sprint project which was executed in keras/tensorflow.  

## Objectives:
    - learning PyTorch frameworks
    - learn fastai api
    - iterate on and extend simple POC "sneaker finder"
    - experiment with nbdev


The intention is to also make this repository the basis of the iterations of snkr-finder including:

    - validation of results through categorization via logistic regression of latent vectors
    - essentially identical categorizing model via transfer learning using
        - mobile net V2
        - resnet
    - "snkr-gen". a sneaker automated desing tool utilizing a variational latent space representaion of sneakers to generate novel sneakers 
        - e.g. sneaker math:   airmax + converse all star


## CAVEATS:

    - might change the neame to snkr-utils
    - i like IDEs, but I also like experimentation so I'm going to immerse myself in this mode and see how it works for me.
